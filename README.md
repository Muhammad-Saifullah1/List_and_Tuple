# Python Lists and Tuples – Basics

## Overview

This project demonstrates the basic concepts of **Python Lists and Tuples**.
It includes examples of creating, accessing, modifying, and using built-in methods for both data structures.

This is a beginner-friendly practice project for understanding Python collections.

---

## Concepts Covered

### List

A **list** is an ordered and mutable (changeable) collection.

The following operations are demonstrated:

* Creating a list
* Indexing (positive and negative)
* Updating elements
* List methods:

  * `append()`
  * `insert()`
  * `remove()`
  * `pop()`
* List slicing

Example:

```python
my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]
```

Operations performed:

* Access first and last elements
* Replace an element with a string
* Add and remove items
* Extract a portion of the list using slicing

---

### Tuple

A **tuple** is an ordered and immutable (unchangeable) collection.

The following operations are demonstrated:

* Creating a tuple
* Indexing
* Understanding immutability (cannot modify values)
* Tuple methods:

  * `count()`
  * `index()`

Example:

```python
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30)
```

---

## Program Output

The program prints the result after each operation to clearly show how lists and tuples behave.

---

## Learning Purpose

This project helps beginners understand:

* Difference between List and Tuple
* Mutable vs Immutable data types
* Basic Python collection operations

---

## List vs Tuple

| Feature     | List         | Tuple      |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Mutable     | Yes          | No         |
| Syntax      | `[]`         | `()`       |
| Performance | Slower       | Faster     |
| Use Case    | Dynamic data | Fixed data |

---

## Requirements

* Python 3.x

Run the program:

```bash
python List_and_Tuple.py
```
